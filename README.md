# Node-Basics

The basic code to create a server in Node.js with Express. 

# Installation

Download the code and install the dependencies:

```shell
npm install
```

Then, just run the server:

```shell
node server.js
```

# Optional

To use as a template, I would like to recommend to install Nodemon, a library to reload us server with each change in the code. 
To do that, install the library:

```shell
npm install -g nodemon
```

And then run the project the following command:

```shell
nodemon server.js
```
